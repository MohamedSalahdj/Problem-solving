"""
    Create a Vector class with x and a y attributes that represent component magnitudes in the x and y directions.
    Your vectors should handle vector additon with an .add() method that takes a second vector as an argument and 
    returns a new vector equal to the sum of the vector you call .add() on and the vector you pass in.

For example:
    >>> a = Vector(3, 4)
    >>> a.x
    3
    >>> a.y
    4
    >>> b = Vector(1, 2)
    >>> c = a.add(b)
    >>> c.x
    4
    >>> c.y
    6
    Adding vectors when you have their components is easy: just add the two x components together and the two y components together to get the x and y components for the vector sum.
