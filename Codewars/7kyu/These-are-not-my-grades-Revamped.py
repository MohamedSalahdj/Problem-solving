    At the end of the last semester, Prof. 
    Joey Greenhorn implemented an online report card for his students in order to save paper. 
    Everything seemed to be working fine back then, but since the start of the new semester 
    he has received several emails from students complaining about erroneous grades showing up in their online report cards. 
    Can you help him correct his implementation of the "Student" class?

The "Student" class should behave like this :
    someStudent = Student()
    someOtherStudent = Student()
    someStudent.add_grade(98)
    someOtherStudent.add_grade(77)
    someStudent.grades == [98] # Evaluates to True
    someOtherStudent.grades == [77] # Evaluates to True

But right now, this is happening :
    someStudent = Student()
    someOtherStudent = Student()
    someStudent.add_grade(98)
    someOtherStudent.add_grade(77)
    someStudent.grades == [98, 77] # Evaluates to True
    someOtherStudent.grades == [98, 77] # Evaluates to True

# Old Code

class Student:

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, grades=[]):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.grades = grades
    
    def add_grade(self, grade):
        self.grades.append(grade)
    
    def get_average(self):
        return sum(self.grades) / len(self.grades)


# Solution

class Student:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, grades=None):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.grades = grades or []

    def add_grade(self, grade):
        self.grades.append(grade)

    def get_average(self):
        return sum(self.grades) / len(self.grades) if self.grades else 0
